    <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Toghrul. I am from Azerbajjan. When I was a child, I used to watch TV shows and movies a lot. These 2 things were my passion. I watched not only what was happening on TV or in the movies, but also what was happening around me with admiration, surprise, and interest. Then I started filming what I saw with my small camera. 
</p>
    
    <p>After that, I studied TV directing and got a BA degree to become a professional. I worked as a director, editor, producer, video editor in the TV field for more than 6 years.</p>
    
    <p>A few years ago, after moving to the United States, I started my own YouTube channel, where I continued to tell stories. I made some videos about various media theories, social media, traditional media, technology and more.</p>
    
    <p>Moving from a country where technology is relatively underdeveloped (Azerbaijan) to a country where technology is developing very fast (USA) increased my interest in this field even more. As a child, I watched what was happening with interest, excitement, and surprise, so in the United States, I began to watch what was happening in the technology and computer field with the same childish enthusiasm.</p>
        
    <p>AI technology, new technological tools that will deeply affect human life, endless discussions about what these tools will bring to humanity, etc. increased my interest  and I decided to study in this field. I am currently studying Associate degree in Software development. My goal is not only to remain a follower of what is happening in this field, but also to succeed as a professional.</p>
